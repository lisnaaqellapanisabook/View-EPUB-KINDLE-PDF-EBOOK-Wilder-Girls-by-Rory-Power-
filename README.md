Title: ReallyDisappointedjustTOXic
Date: Reviewed in the United States on August 2, 2019
Review: I was really looking forward to this book. The blurb sounded so good and interesting and I was ready for a disease/outbreak book. Give me all the paranoia. Give me all the fear. Sadly, that was not what I got.SPOILERS! SPOILER WARNING! SPOILERS AHEAD! YOU'VE BEEN WARNED!I was ready for the paranoia when we found Welch was throwing out food. I thought that was odd, but I also thought it was odd the Navy/CDC would send them opened food. Like what the heck? So, I was on Welch's side. Better safe than sorry. But nothing really happened from that besides the start of Hetty's never ending guilt.I think things really started picking up when Byatt was found missing but not by much. It was interesting to see Byatt's perspective though. I really wish I would've known more about the girls. I didn't feel connected to these characters. I didn't really know who they were. Byatt likes lying, Reese is closed off, and Hetty is guilt-ridden. That's all I can tell you about them honestly. I'll forget about these characters by tomorrow. They felt flat to me with no real personality. I related to their friendship where 2 are closer with one "extra" but that's about it.I also feel like there was a huge plot hole. So the disease is not really a disease but a parasite? Fine. But there were 8 other girls beside Byatt. The Navy/CDC has 8 bodies. Hetty even mentioned they probably did an autopsy on Mona's body... SO WOULDN'T THEY HAVE FOUND THE WORM during said autopsy??? Makes no sense to me??? I suppose the worm could've hopped out of their bodies, but wouldn't someone have noticed a 5 inch worm crawling around? And how did Teddy get infected then? Byatt still had the worm in her body because she dug it out herself. Unless she had 2 worms and one decided to move out? I have so many questions.I also don't understand why Headmistress would allow the Navy/CDC to conduct this investigation. She knew something was wrong before everything started. Why didn't she leave the island herself? Was she getting paid for this? I don't care how much money I was offered; I wouldn't willingly let myself become infected with an unknown disease with an unknown cure. 'Nuff said.I'm also really mad at Hetty by the end. She literally signed the other girl's death warrants. Not only did she end their food supply (and also cause the Navy/CDC to send the kill juice), but she let a bear onto the school grounds (and if that doesn't work bombs are coming). She literally ruined 40 girls lives. All of their blood is on her hands. She felt oh soooo guilty, but did she try and figure out a way to save them? NO! She only saved herself. The boat could've saved more of them. They could've tried to make return trips to save as many lives as possible. But the thought didn't even cross her mind. What a b@%*&. She deserved to go down with the ship. I know she didn't mean to, and she was just trying to find her friend. But she killed all those girls and didn't think twice about trying to help them.I didn't enjoy the writing style either. I was so confused in the beginning. It kept jumping from past to present in such a weird way. Not my cup of tea.Overall, I didn't enjoy this book. It was a quick read, but I'm left with too many questions for a standalone novel. Even if a sequel was released, I don't think I'd waste my time on it. I feel really disappointed because I was really feeling the blurb, but it didn't live up to it.

Review: This book had the potential to be so much more. The plot was awesome, and the writing style was really interesting and engaging. There could have been 100-200 more pages to better flesh out the backstory and give it a proper ending. The story development took a long time only for the climax and ending to happen really abruptly. When I finished it, I thought "that's it?". There were so many references to things that would have made the story deeper and more engaging, but they never got mentioned again. Disappointed.
